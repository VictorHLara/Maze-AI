A Python pathfinding visualization tool using Pygame that demonstrates the Greedy Best-First Search algorithm with the Chebyshev distance heuristic, Depth-first search (DFS) and Breadth-first search (BFS). This project provides an interactive way to explore how the algorithm navigates through a predefined maze grid.

## üëæ Features

- **Grid Visualization**: Displays a 2D maze grid with start (green) and end (red) points, walls (black), and visited nodes (yellow).
- **Step-by-Step Animation**: Visualizes the algorithm's exploration process in real-time with a 0.15-second delay between steps.
- **Chebyshev Distance Heuristic**: Uses the formula `max(|x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ|, |y‚ÇÅ - y‚ÇÇ|)` to prioritize node exploration ( for Greedy Search).
- **Priority Queue Management**: Efficiently selects the next node using a priority queue based on heuristic values ( for Greedy Search).
- **Step Counter**: Tracks and displays the total steps taken during the search.
- **Stochastic environment**: 25% chance of noise in the search.  

 ## üìö Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

 ## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VictorHLara/Maze-AI.git
   cd Maze-AI
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
## üïπÔ∏è Usage

  - Start Search: Press the `SPACE` to begin the algorithm.

  - Exit: Close the window or press `ESC`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

1. Modify the Maze:
   - Edit the maze list in mapa.py (0 = walkable, 1 = wall).
2. Change Start/End Positions
   - Update the coordinates in main.py.
  
## üéØ Preview
  - Finished Greedy Search with no noise.
